# AdventureWorks_PowerBI_Dashboard

The management team at Adventure Works needed a solution to track key performance indicators (KPIs) such as orders, revenue, profit, and returns. Moreover, they required a dashboard comprising regional performance, analyzing product-level trends, and efficiently identifying high-value customers.

Initially imported data into Power Query, where extensive data transformation and shaping were performed using various tools. Once the data was refined, it was loaded into Power BI. Subsequently, using Power Pivot, data modelling was undertaken, and DAX measures were created according to specific requirements. Finally, employing a range of visuals and tools, a comprehensive dashboard was created to present the insights derived from the processed data. 

## Highlighted Features/Pages of the Dashboard:

* **KPI Tracking:** Effortlessly monitor sales, revenue, profit, and returns with intuitive cards, providing a quick overview of vital metrics.

* **Product-Level Trends:** Explore in-depth insights into product-level trends with interactive charts, ensuring a thorough understanding of market dynamics.

The dashboard offers a comprehensive view of the business, empowering the management team to navigate the dynamic landscape of manufacturing and cycling with confidence.
